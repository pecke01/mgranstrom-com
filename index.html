  	<p>My name is Marcus Granström and I am a software engineer working for EPiServer. I work mostly with distributed stuff including elasticsearch, lucene, Cassandra and also do some work with node.js. I try to contribute to elasticsearch and lucene as well. </p>

<p>I am one of the co-founders of 200OK AB that built the search service Truffler based on elasticsearch. 200OK was acquired by EPiServer in May 2012 and the product rebranded as EPiServer Find. My co-founders are <a href="http://joelabrahamsson.com">Joel Abrahamsson</a> and <a href="http://www.lindstromhenrik.com">Henrik Lindström</a>.</p>

You can find me on twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/pecke01">@pecke01</a>.
