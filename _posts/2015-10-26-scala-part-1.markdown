Since I started working for Klarna almost five months ago I have started working more and more in scala. I will in a series of blogs around scala explain how to get started with scala and what to think about when using it. I will expect you to be knowledge with programming.

I will give instructions and examples from how I use do it on os x. Should align with linux as well.

##Installing Scala
Head over to [Download scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/) and download the latest version. When writing this it is 2.11.7. Unpack it and place it in ``/usr/local/share/scala-2.11.7``.
Add the following lines to your .bashrc or for me .zshrc since I run zsh.
{%highlight bash%}
export SCALA_HOME=/usr/local/share/scala-2.11.7
export PATH=$PATH:$SCALA_HOME/bin
{% endhighlight %}
You are now able to compile ``scalac`` and run programs with ``scala`` from your terminal.

##First steps
Creating a program that we can run by compiling and doing ``scala first.scala``. For that we need a main method. We are also going to print something on the console out.
Create a file called first.scala and place the following in it.
{%highlight java%}
object ScalaPartOne {
  def main(args: Array[String]){
    println("Scala Part One")
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

You should now be able to run the very simple program by running ``scala first.scala`` in the terminal and it will print ``"Scala Part One"``
