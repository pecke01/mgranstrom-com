In this short video I explain how you can get up and running with EPiServer Find. Everything from creating a developer account on <a href="http://find.episerver.com">http://find.episerver.com</a> to indexing your EPiServer site.

<h3>What to do know?</h3>
My friend Joel Abrahamsson have written a blog post called <a href="http://joelabrahamsson.com/episerver-find-101/">EPiServer Find 101</a> where he gives more information on what to do. It is a great read, I recommend that you read it.
